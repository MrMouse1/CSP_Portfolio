          <p>   My name is Mikhail Romanovskiy, and my goal is to make life simpler. I am on my way to become a Robotic Engineer, the one who improves people's lives by reducing monotone activity to help them save more time. The overall process of automatization always was a large part of human society right until these days, and I will become a part of this process.</p>

          <p w-100>I did not always know what I will do in the future, but math was the number one interest, and I knew that my life would connect with it. When in the sixth grade, I moved to America from Russia, and I intuitively found out programming easy for me to learn. During my first three years in America, I partially learned JavaScript and create approximately 70 projects of various difficulties. The individual study of code makes me not only a more independent individual but also helps me to study a new language better. When in eighth grade, I asked my teacher to take math one level higher than I have to and reached success in it. I was fortunate with my first high school, there was an engineering lab with various drills and saws, and it was also filled with computers, 3D printers, and laser cutters. During my freshman year in Mountain View High School, I worked with a group of students older and more experienced than me but was resourceful and supportive to them. The most exaggerating period in my school life within the past couple of years was transferring two years ago in the middle of the semester, but I passed it.</p>

          <p> Before the pandemic struck, I was a member of the Dublin Robot Club - its program includes work in a team, tournament trips, the building of complex mechanics, and programming on modified C++. Whatever it is not related to programming or engineering activity, for the last seven years, I am also acting in Russian Theater in JCCSF (Jewish Community Center of San Francisco) that positively affects my teamwork and learning skills. Our team is currently assembling online that proves how strong the relationships we built are. I have many hobbies starting from cooking to biking and playing basketball, but one of them is a bit extraordinary. I like to play games, and not just play, but explore their physics and mechanics and even repeat the simplest of them on JavaScript in Khan Academy or, since some time ago, by using Scratch.</p>

          <p w-100>During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, I have found out one more useful trait about myself. I'm very well socially adaptive; I could work and live isolated and within society on approximately the same level. My psychology is very sustainable for such social changes.</p>

          <p w-100>Overall, my experience as a Robotic Engineer is not complete at all, but I'm working hard in this direction. Also, I have already learned about myself that can be a good team member and join almost any project in the middle to improve it with creative ideas.</p>
