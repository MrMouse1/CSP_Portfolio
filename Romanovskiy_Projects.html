          <h4>Project: Scratch Mini-Game</h4> 
          <h5>Course: CSP (Computer Science Principles)</h5>
          <h5>Duration: 1 week</h5>
          <h5>Objective: Create a game on Scratch in partnership</h5>

          <p>When we start developing a concept, we stopped at the multiple-platformer rush game. We separate our job on three main parts: level's design, movement mechanics, look choose mechanics. Each of us had full access to everything during the entire project, and levels creation and look options were a sum of collaborative decisions. However, I was more focused on movement mechanics and Vishal was more focused on documentation.</p>

          <p>This project gave me an experience of work under pressure because of its short terms and trained brainstorm skills.</p>

          <h4><br/>Project: Serial Killer Project</h4> 
          <h5>Course: Forensic Science</h5>
          <h5>Duration: 3 months</h5>
          <h5>Objective: Create a presentation for a chosen serial killer</h5>

          <p>The first information about this project was given a month befor the winter break, so the actual time was give about 3 and half week. First and longest part of the project was researching the data and combining it in one toghether. Second, that took about three weeks was creating the presentation about the chosen serial killer, in my case, it was Harvey Miguel Robinson.</p>

          <p>This project gave me an experience of data managment and data organization.</p>

          <h4><br/>Project: AOI Circuit Design - Sentry Turret</h4> 
          <h5>Course: DE (Digital Electronics)</h5>
          <h5>Duration: 3 weeks</h5>
          <h5>Objective: Create a circuit for a real-life application</h5>

          <p>My team and I have explored different topics for this project until we stopped at the military protection of countries located near and within dangerous regions. Our design statement was to "create a defense system that can detect the difference between an enemy or anything else that may be moving." What stood out in this project in comparison to others we have done before is step-by-step cooperation, where not only the parts of the whole divided between team members but those segments follow each other one by one within the time limits.</p>

          <p>This project teached me not only to take care of my part of the job, but also to pay attention to others; to make sure the team is working like clockwork.</p>
