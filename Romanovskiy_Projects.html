          <h4>Project: Scratch Mini-Game</h4> 
          <h5>Course: CSP (Computer Science Principles)</h5>
          <h5>Duration: 1 week</h5>
          <h5>Objective: Create a game on Scratch in partnership</h5>

          <p>When we start developing a concept, we stopped at the multi-platformer rush game. We separate our job into three main parts: level's design, movement mechanics, look choose mechanics. Each of us had full access to everything during the entire project, and levels creation and look options were a sum of collaborative decisions. However, I was more focused on movement mechanics, while Vishal was more focused on documentation.</p>

          <p>This project gave me the experience of work under pressure because of its short-length term and trained my brainstorming skills.</p>

          <h4><br/>Project: Serial Killer Project</h4> 
          <h5>Course: Forensic Science</h5>
          <h5>Duration: 3 months (1 month)</h5>
          <h5>Objective: Create a presentation for a chosen serial killer</h5>

          <p>While the first information to be prepared to research about this project was given a month and a half in advance, the actual time given was about three and a half weeks. The first and longest part of the project was researching the data and combining it in one together. The second, which took about three weeks, was creating the presentation about the chosen serial killer, who in my case, was Harvey Miguel Robinson.</p>

          <p>This project gave me experience in data management and data organization.</p>

          <h4><br/>Project: AOI Circuit Design - Sentry Turret</h4> 
          <h5>Course: DE (Digital Electronics)</h5>
          <h5>Duration: 3 weeks</h5>
          <h5>Objective: Create a circuit for a real-life application</h5>

          <p>My team and I have explored different topics for this project until we stopped at the military protection of countries allocated near or within dangerous regions. Our design statement was to "create a defense system that can detect the difference between an enemy and anything else that may be moving." What stood out in this project, is what in comparison to other projects we have done before is step-by-step cooperation, where were not only the parts of the whole divided between team members but those segments follow each other one by one within the time limits.</p>

          <p>This project taught me not only to take care of my part of the job but also to pay attention to others; to make sure the team is working like clockwork.</p>

          <h4><br/>Project: PLD Design - 4 Bits Hexadecimal Counter</h4> 
          <h5>Course: DE (Digital Electronics)</h5>
          <h5>Duration: 1 weeks</h5>
          <h5>Objective: Create a circuit for a real-life application</h5>

          <p>After brainstorming for some time, I decided to make a translator from one numerical system to another. It was from binary system to hexadecimal system within one hexadecimal symbol (or sixteen bits). There was nothing new in creating this kind of circuit at the moment, so the most challenging part of this project was the troubleshooting due to a large number of segments. The project required calculations, documentation, and building a simulation, but transferring the simulation into an actual circuit, PLD, was the part that caused the most errors and difficulties. </p>

          <p>This project taught me to efficiently divide notable chunks of work and then manipulate it easily.</p>
